# A file to practice algorithms
# Write algorithm on paper first
# Then convert to code

# PROGRAM 1
# Ask the user for two numbers and add them

# inital values
x = 0
y = 0
sum = 0

# ask user for input
# store input in variables
x = input('Pick a number: ')
y = input('Pick another number: ')

# convert to ints in new variables
# add new variables together
newX = int(x)
newY = int(y)
sum = newX + newY

# print output of results
print('The sum is... ')
print(sum)
